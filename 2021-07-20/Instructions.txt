The folders are as follows:

Redistributables
================
This folder contains the VC_redist.x64.exe application which is published by Microsoft corporation.
Anyone wanting to use any of the Windows based tools should first run this application to ensure
that pre-requisites for the Windows tools are installed on your Windows 10 machine. This only needs
to be run ONCE in the lifetime of your computer.

AuditViewer
===========
This folder contains the SailAuditInterface.exe. Once the 'Redistributables' are installed, this
application can be simply executed. Make sure the run the application with all of the contents of
the folder in the same folder.

Windows Azure Initializer
=========================
Like the Audit Viewer, this is a standalone application which must be executed with the current
folder content (i.e. application depends on four DLL's which must be in the same folder as the
application executable). The SecureComputationalVirtualMachine.binaries should also be within
the same folder as the executable.

This application can be executed in three different modes.

In the first mode, you load all your settings from a configuration file. An example of that is
contained within the SettingsAndConfigurationFiles folder (i.e. SampleLoadFromSettingsFiles.cfg).
Using a settings files allows you to have multiple virtual machines, each with their own separate
digital contract and dataset.

The second mode is the fully manual mode. If you want to run this, make sure to run the
QuickRegistrySetup.reg which is within the SampleLoadFromSettingsFile.txt. This .reg file will add
some registry settings which auto-fills a lot of the input fields in the manual mode dialog. In
this mode, you can specific only ONE digital contract and dataset, so effectively you can end up with
a plurality of virtual machines all of which host the same digital contract and dataset.

The third mode is a debug mode which bypasses the Azure provisioning and binaries installation and
only focuses on sending the initialization packet to the InitializerProcess. This is only usable when
someone runs the RootOfTrustProcess manually.

Computational Orchestrator
==========================
Refer to the readme in that folder for information on how to deploy and use.

DatasetSpecificationTool
========================
This folder contains the application program used to generate datasets from raw data.

Datasets
========
This folder contains all of the datasets that we have fabricated for testing

Binaries
========
This folder contains all of the raw binaries in unpackaged form. This is mostly useful for debugging
purposes, etc...
